    "\n",
    "- **Explore the hyperparameters of your models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each models have their own hyperparameters. And each of the hyperparameter have different effects on the model behaviour.

    "Cross-validation is a critical technique in machine learning and data science for evaluating and validating the performance of predictive models. It provides a more **robust** and **reliable** evaluation method compared to a hold-out (single train-test set) validation. Though, it requires more time and computing power because of how cross-validation works. (Hint: k-fold cross-validation, stratified k-fold cross-validation, etc.)\n",

    "Ensemble methods are powerful machine learning techniques that combine the predictions of multiple models (often referred to as base learners or weak learners) to create a stronger, more accurate predictive model. The idea behind ensemble methods is that by aggregating the opinions of multiple models, you can reduce the impact of individual model errors and improve overall prediction performance. (Hint: bagging, boosting, stacking, voting)\n",

    "Model interpretation is the process of understanding and explaining the inner workings of a machine learning model, particularly its decision-making process. Interpretation helps data scientists, stakeholders, and end-users gain insights into why a model makes certain predictions or classifications. Model interpretation is crucial for building trust in machine learning systems, identifying biases, and extracting actionable information from models.
